        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>

Hello and welcome! I’m Nikhil, a passionate makeup artist and the creative force behind Makeover by Nikki. With a deep love for the art of makeup and a commitment to enhancing natural beauty, I have dedicated my career to helping individuals feel confident and empowered through personalized makeup and makeover experiences.

My journey into the world of makeup began with making my daughter get ready for her school and later on for family occasions and there is all where this journey of mine started. Over the years, I have honed my skills through training, education, or significant experiences, I am continuously inspired by the transformative power of makeup.

At Makeover by Nikki, I specialize in bridal makeup, groom makeup, editorial looks, special effects, HD makeup, airbrush makeup, no-makeup looks, etc. My approach is all about collaboration, ensuring that each client’s unique style and personality shine through. Whether it’s for a special event, a photoshoot, or an everyday look, I am dedicated to creating beautiful and memorable makeup experiences tailored to your needs.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and help you discover the magic of makeup.
